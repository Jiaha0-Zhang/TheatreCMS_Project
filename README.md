# TheatreCMS_Project

## Introduction

This is a 2-week Live project for a theatre company designed software to manage the content, I worked with my peers in a team developing a full scale MVC Web Application in C#. My main job was to complete some stories assigned by the director, including the redesign of the web pages, adding some functions and features of click events, creating entity models and modifying some controllers.

In this project, each of us played an important role and we were all assigned to both front-end and back-end tasks. Completing some relatively big changes would take up a lot of time, so I tried to complete most of the contents and requirements with what I had learned, and then spent extra time searching for similar solutions from various resources to solve the parts I didn't understand, including consulting the director and peers in my team. The number of stories I ended up completing far exceeded expectation and the requirements for pass.
